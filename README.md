## System Architecture
The StudyByte  platform consists of three main components: the front end, the back end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the front end serving as the client and the back end and database serving as the server.

### Front-end:
The front end of the platform is built using ReactJS, ReactJS allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces, which are critical for providing an engaging learning experience to the students. The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls.

### Back-end:
The back end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS,. The back end provides APIs for the front end to consume, which include functionalities such as user authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back end also handles the logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.

### Database:
The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of unstructured and semi-structured data. The database stores the course content, user data, and other relevant information related to the platform.

## Architecture Diagram:
Here is a high-level diagram that illustrates the architecture of the StudyByte ed-tech platform:
